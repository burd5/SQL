Given a table of Facebook posts, for each user who posted at least twice in 2021, write a query to find the number of days between each userâ€™s first post of the year and last post of the year in the year 2021. Output the user and number of the days between each user's first and last post.

-- My Solution

SELECT user_id, DATE_PART('day', max(post_date) - min(post_date)) as days_between
FROM posts
WHERE extract(year from post_date) = 2021
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING count(user_id) > 1;

    MAX(post_date::DATE) - MIN(post_date::DATE) AS days_between
FROM posts
WHERE DATE_PART('year', post_date::DATE) = 2021 
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(post_id)>1;

select
  user_id,
  max(post_date::date) - min(post_date::date) as days_between
from posts
where date_part('year', post_date) = 2021
group by user_id
having count(user_id) > 1
