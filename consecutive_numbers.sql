-- Consecutive Numbers

/*
Find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
