Table: Product

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| product_id   | int     |

+-------------+---------+
This table can have duplicate rows.
product_id is a foreign key (reference column) to the Product table.
Each row of this table contains some information about one sale.
 

Write a solution to report the products that were only sold in the first quarter of 2019. That is, between 2019-01-01 and 2019-03-31 inclusive.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

*/

-- My solution

SELECT DISTINCT p.product_id, p.product_name
FROM product p JOIN sales s on p.product_id = s.product_id
WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-03-31' 
AND p.product_id NOT IN (SELECT product_id FROM sales WHERE sale_date NOT BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-03-31')

-- Other solution using min/max

select product_id,product_name
from product natural join sales
group by product_id
having min(sale_date)>='2019-01-01' and max(sale_date)<='2019-03-31'
