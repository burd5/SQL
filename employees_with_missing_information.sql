-- My Solution

SELECT employee_id
FROM employees
WHERE employee_id NOT IN (SELECT employee_id FROM salaries)

UNION

SELECT employee_id
FROM salaries
WHERE employee_id NOT IN (SELECT employee_id FROM employees)

ORDER BY employee_id

-- Other Solutions

SELECT T.employee_id
FROM  
  (SELECT * FROM Employees LEFT JOIN Salaries USING(employee_id)
   UNION 
   SELECT * FROM Employees RIGHT JOIN Salaries USING(employee_id))
AS T
WHERE T.salary IS NULL OR T.name IS NULL
ORDER BY employee_id;
